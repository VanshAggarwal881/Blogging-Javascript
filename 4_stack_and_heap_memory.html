    <h1>JavaScript Engines Have Two Places to Store Data <br>
    1) Stack <br>
    2) Heap</h1>
    <h2>* <u>Stack</u> : It is a data structure used to store static data. Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time. <br>
        In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined. References that point to objects and functions are also included. <br>
        A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation. </h2>

    <h2>* <u>Heap</u> : It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory. Instead, it allocates more space as required.</h2>
    <p style="border: 1px solid black;"> Note: When you use a JavaScript object in a template literal (i.e., with backticks ``), JavaScript converts the object to a string using the object's toString method. <br>
        For plain objects, this results in the string "[object Object]".

        To print the object with its keys and values within a template literal, you can use JSON.stringify to convert the object to a JSON string representation:</p>

// STACK(PRIMITIVE DATE TYPE)
// let x = "Vansh Aggarwal"
// y = x
// console.log(`value of x is given to y: ${y}`);
// console.log("changing value of y will not effect the value of x as primitive data types are stored in the stack memory where the copy is given to another variable so...");
// y = "aggarwal vansh"
// console.log('value of x : ' , x);
// console.log('value of y : ' ,y);

newobj = obj

console.log(`Value of newobj is same as obj ${JSON.stringify(newobj)}`);
console.log(newobj);
newobj.age = 22
console.log("changing the value of a key that is age to 22 through the newobj and it will change as non primitives are stored in the heap memory and the reference to the original is provided");
console.log(obj);
